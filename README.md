# Door Step Service - Android App


The main aim of this project is to develop an Application which helps the users to get the services at home directly by choosing the services they want to be done on their selected time and their own selected vendors. The users can select the services and then they would have a flexibility to select the vendors they want service from by looking at the reviews of all the service providers.

After the user has selected the services they want, they would receive a notification regarding their order. The vendor would also get a notification as the order has been placed by the user to their services. There would be some access privileges provided to the regular customers as well as the ones who selects a certain amount of services at a time. There are Google Maps implemented where in a user can get their current location displayed on screen which can help user to search nearby vendors.
